/*
Homework Questions:
Write code the performs the following functions using both for and while loops:

Prints out all the even numbers from 50 to 100 (inclusive)
Sums the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints out the sum one time in the end.
Prints out every even number that is one more or one less than a multiple of 5 from 1 to 100 inclusive.
Prints out all numbers that are either multiples of 3 or multiples of 4, but not both. (a bit challenging)
HARD: Prints out the fibonacci numbers (If you don't know what they are you should google it!)

public class question1 {
    public static void main(String args[]){
         for(int i=50; i<101; i=i+2){
              System.out.println(i);
         }
    }
}

//Note: I wrote everything only using for loops because we haven't learned about while loops in class yet
