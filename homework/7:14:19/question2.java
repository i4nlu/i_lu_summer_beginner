/*
Homework Questions:
Write code the performs the following functions using both for and while loops:

Prints out all the even numbers from 50 to 100 (inclusive)
Sums the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints out the sum one time in the end.
Prints out every even number that is one more or one less than a multiple of 5 from 1 to 100 inclusive.
Prints out all numbers that are either multiples of 3 or multiples of 4, but not both. (a bit challenging)
HARD: Prints out the fibonacci numbers (If you don't know what they are you should google it!)
